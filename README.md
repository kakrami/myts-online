# myTS 6.0.7

Cloudflare Worker + D1 team dashboard rebuilt around one integrated TeamSnap + Trace experience.

## Product flow

- **Overview** combines TeamSnap schedule/availability with current-season Trace performance leaders and recent matches.
- **Matches** is the single timeline for games, practices, and other team events. Opening a game gives a FotMob-style match center with score context, player stats, goal events, and TeamSnap availability.
- **Player profiles** combine match/season performance, corrected Trace heat maps, position profile, tracked distance, attacking-third share, field coverage, match history, and TeamSnap availability. Trace-tagged shots/touch involvement remain available in the underlying dataset but are not presented as complete event counts. A player opened from a match starts in match context and can move naturally to the season profile.
- **Team** combines roster, availability, appearances, starts, minutes, goals, assists, and rate stats in one table.
- **Reports** provides Excel and PDF exports without duplicating the normal dashboard workflow.
- Opponent H2H is opened contextually from a match/opponent instead of living in a separate History section.

Trace is a data source, not a separate product area. Owner controls for connecting Trace, checking for new games, exporting the unified dataset, or manually importing `myts_trace_data.json` live under **Account & Data Sources**. The separate **Settings** control contains only the pre-season inclusion toggle.

## UI / table behavior

- Every data table is sortable by tapping/clicking a column header.
- Match player stats are compacted to fit mobile width without horizontal scrolling; larger multi-column report/team tables retain overflow only where necessary.
- Match detail uses a compact sticky title; team names remain in the score hero instead of repeating in the top bar.

## Trace data

- The included `myts_trace_data.json` is the unified historical seed/fallback dataset.
- It contains 108 processed matches and spatial player-game data, including 24×16 heat-map grids and normalized event/stat data.
- Manual import seeds existing history so a connected Trace account only needs to collect new or changed games.
- Automatic Trace processing is incremental and stores the compact normalized result in D1.
- R2 is not required.

## Files

- `worker.js` — deploy this Worker; the complete frontend is embedded.
- `wrangler.jsonc` — Worker, D1, and scheduler configuration.
- `package.json` — Wrangler package metadata.
- `myts_trace_data.json` — unified Trace seed/fallback dataset.
- `.dev.vars.example` — local `ADMIN_KEY` example.
- `.gitignore`

There is intentionally no `index.html` or `tools/` folder in the production bundle.

## Deploy

Keep the existing D1 binding named `DB` and the existing `ADMIN_KEY` secret, replace the repository files with this bundle, and deploy with Wrangler. TeamSnap OAuth continues to redirect to `/admin`.

## Version

`v6.0.7` is shown beside the myTS logo on both the login screen and loaded dashboard, so the deployed version is visible immediately.

## 6.0.7 calendar-date consistency

- Calendar dates and timestamps now use separate handling throughout the dashboard. A `YYYY-MM-DD` value is never timezone-shifted.
- Trace `played_at` UTC timestamps are converted to the team calendar timezone before selecting a match day.
- Trace catalog refreshes reconcile dates against current TeamSnap fixtures and the saved connection evidence, so older Trace connections self-correct without a reset.
- Calendar-only corrections reuse the existing saved Trace source/Halo data and only queue a lightweight engine republish; historical raw tracking is not downloaded again.
- The stats API now exposes `played_at`, allowing every Trace view to resolve the same canonical calendar day.
- Overview, Fixtures, match details, Stats, player profiles, recent matches, History/H2H, reports, season filtering, and import/catalog views all use the same date helpers.
- The bundled 108-match historical seed was migrated using `America/Los_Angeles`; 28 UTC-evening records that were one calendar day late were corrected.

## 6.0.6 interface polish

- Rebuilt the visual type scale so normal interface text is readable instead of relying on 6–10px labels and very heavy 900/950 weights.
- Uses the native variable/system UI font stack for sharper rendering without adding another external font dependency.
- Increased hierarchy and line-height across page titles, cards, tables, match rows, player profiles, reports, settings, and source controls.
- Standardized buttons, inputs, selectors, cards, modal geometry, hover states, keyboard focus, and mobile touch targets.
- Added tabular numerals for scores and stats so columns and scorelines align cleanly.
- Simplified user-facing stats wording and removed the asterisk-style assist label while keeping the best-effort explanation in context.
- Added accessible labels to icon-only controls and reduced-motion behavior.
- Corrected the visible frontend version badge/runtime version so the UI now matches the deployed bundle version.
## 6.0.2 season history fix

- Season choices now come from the union of TeamSnap seasons, saved TeamSnap event dates, and the unified Trace dataset.
- Historical TeamSnap team records already saved in D1 are preserved during refresh instead of being dropped when TeamSnap only returns the current team.
- Trace-only historical seasons remain selectable even if TeamSnap no longer exposes an old team record.


## 6.0.5 date and goal/assist consistency

- Date-only fixture values remain calendar dates instead of being parsed as UTC midnight. This fixes Pacific-time display drift such as the Sep 5, 2026 ALBION match appearing as Sep 4.
- Goal occurrence/timing is capped to the official Trace score.
- Scorer attribution uses explicit Trace roles first, then an evidence-weighted best-effort model using superfollow/AOS involvement, Halo on-field evidence, season attacking profile, and unique Trace/GID evidence. Generic GID order is never treated as scorer order.
- Assist attribution uses explicit roles first, then Trace sequence/predecessor evidence, superfollow/AOS, Halo presence, and season creation profile. Weak assist guesses remain unresolved.
- Player G/A totals, match events, season totals, and heat-map G/A markers now come from the same canonical event model. Map markers are retained only when a stored tracked location matches the canonical player/event.
- The bundled 108-match historical seed has been rebuilt with the same attribution policy.
- Trace engine 1.8.0-browser reprocesses existing stored source games without re-downloading raw game/radar/Halo data; the background continuation also includes engine-only refresh work.
